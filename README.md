# Tetris
A tile-matching puzzle video game which I am sure everyone is familiar with. This game is
implemented with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas API played via web browser.

## Functionality & MVP
+ `→` (right arrow key) moves block to the right
+ `←` (left arrow key) moves block to the left
+ `s` (s key) rotates the block clockwise
+ `d` (d key) rotates the block counter-clockwise
+ `↓` (down arroy key) soft drops the tile
+ `spacebar` hard drops the tile  
+ `p` pauses the game


## Wireframes
This game will consist of a single screen with the game board, top score & score boards on the left,
a next piece box & sound toggle on the right, and finally, nav links to my personal site, Github,
and LinkedIn at the bottom of the board.
